<h2> Hi üëã ! I'm Ranak</h2>

I am a software engineer who possess a deep passion for problem-solving and programming. My educational background includes a Bacehlor in Software Engineering from the esteemed Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, Sylhet. During my university years, I actively participated in both problem-solving and software development. My enthusiasm for programming led me to take part in over 200 programming contests, where I solved over 1200 complex problems.

My experience extends beyond contest participation and into academic and real-world projects, including game and web development. My expertise in these areas is backed by a strong academic foundation, which I have complemented with a research background in the domain of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. As a result of my hard work and dedication, I have an accepted paper in ICDAR, the premier document analysis and recognition conference. Find My paper here : https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05325

In summary, my academic and practical experience has provided me with a comprehensive skillset to solve complex problems and develop software solutions.

My expertise lies in Javascript ( Express, React, Redux, MUI, Chakra UI etc) In addition, I also have working experience in PHP and Python.

I love to solve problems, develop and implement new ideas and learn new
technologies.
