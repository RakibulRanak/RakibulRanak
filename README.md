## Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm Ranak

I am a software engineer who possess a deep passion for problem-solving and programming. My educational background includes a Bacehlor in Software Engineering from the esteemed Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, Sylhet. During my university years, I actively participated in both problem-solving and software development. My enthusiasm for programming led me to take part in over 200 programming contests, where I solved over 1200 problems.

My experience extends beyond contest participation and into academic and real-world projects, including game and web development. My expertise in these areas is backed by a strong academic foundation, which I have complemented with a research background in the domain of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. As a result of my hard work and dedication, I have an accepted paper in ICDAR, the premier document analysis and recognition conference.
